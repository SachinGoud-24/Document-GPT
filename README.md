# Document-GPT
A web app using streamlit front-end and python backend to upload documents and interact with the data. The project uses openai api for text generation and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to provide context and feed custom data to the LLM.


## Streamlit requirements:
Be aware that streamlit on macos needs Openssl but in mac by default LibreSSL is being used.
I used homebrew to install openssl and it worked.
